Come experience a wonderful weekend on the beautiful and serene island of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The Hilton Head Island Gullah Celebration will be kicking off its 19th annual celebration on January 30, 2015 at the Art League of Hilton Head Gallery at Arts Center of Coastal Carolina, 14 Shelter Cove Lane, Hilton Head Island, SC 29926. Join us on Friday, January 30 at the De Arts Ob We People Art Exhibit - Opening Reception. Patrons and visitors will have the first opportunity to see the display of original works by leading and emerging Gullah artists. After a splendid evening at De Arts Ob We People Art Exhibit, head on over to the historic Cherry Hill School for the Ol’ Fashioned Gullah Breakfast on Saturday, January 31 at 8am. Experience homestyle cooking that shows some, and reminds others of, a traditional Gullah breakfast: featuring your choice of stewed oysters, shrimp in a savory lowcountry gravy, fried fresh catch fish paired with hot butter grits and fresh biscuits. Meals are prepared by people of the local Gullah community coordinated by Ooman Chef Louise Cohen. Continue experiencing Hilton Head Island on January 31 at the Freedom Day Event which is also conveniently located at the historic Cherry Hill School. National Freedom Day was established in 1948 by President Harry Truman in remembrance of February 1, 1865 - the day President Lincoln signed the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which outlawed slavery. We mark this historical occasion with artists’ interpretations and musical performances showcasing the contributions of African Americans in South Carolina History.
