Are you participating in our Gullah Celebration <a href="//bit.ly/WVTJR5">Fish Haul Creek 5K</a> race on February 9<sup>th</sup>? It’s not too late for a bit of conditioning. <!--more--> Proper form requires your head to be up, your chest open, elbows bent, shoulders relaxed, and arms swinging. Here are a few suggestions for the big race to improve performance and decrease your chance of injury: <img style="float: right;" src="//bit.ly/W1wjxK" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> <em>Upper body</em>- Do one upper body workout per week. This can include flat bench presses, standing cable rows, shoulder presses, bicep dumbbell curls, triceps dips, or dumbbell shrugs. You should aim for two to three sets of 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. <a href="//binged.it/WVTK7j">Here</a> is a 20 minute upper body workout you can do from home that includes a few of the suggested exercises. &nbsp; <em>Lower body</em>- A weekly lower body workout could include barbell back squats, walking dumbbell lunges, one-leg dumbbell dead lifts, and step-ups on a bench. Again, aim for two to three sets of 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. <a href="//binged.it/W1wiKa">Here</a> is a 12 minute lower body workout you can do from home. &nbsp; <em>High intensity runs</em>- A great way to improve your capacity to run hard and fast over a longer period of time is to incorporate weekly high intensity running into your exercise regimen. Sprint for 30 seconds, walk for 90 seconds, and repeat for a twenty minute workout. You can also try running up a hill and then walking or jogging back down 10 to 15 times. &nbsp; <em>Warm up stretches for the big day</em>- Make sure you stretch your muscles before and after the race to help prevent injuries. <a href="//bit.ly/147lVHF">Here</a> is a site that offers suggested stretches. You can also warm up your muscles by doing a light five minute jog before the race begins. &nbsp; The 5K race begins 2/9/2013 at 9 AM, with registration and number pick-up from 7 AM – 8:45. We begin at the historic Cherry Hill School, continue through Baygall, go past Mitchellville Beach and the Atlantic Ocean, and double back around to the school. &nbsp; 5K too much? Grab the kids and try out the 1/2K. &nbsp; The Fish Haul Creek 5K race is a truly a fun event for the entire family!
