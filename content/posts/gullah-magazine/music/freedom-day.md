<p>This Saturday at St. James Baptist Church you are cordially invited to come and see <em>Freedom Day</em>, a riveting story based on true accounts of wounded soldiers at Mitchellville, circa 1865.&nbsp; From 10 AM &ndash; 3 PM, there will be live performances, freedom songs, food, and arts &amp; crafts at 209 Dillon Road, Hilton Head, SC. <img style="float: right;" src="//bit.ly/W4e99K" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p><br/><p>The Emancipation Proclamation was issued 150 years ago on January 1, 1863 by President Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp; The nation had undergone two years of a civil war, and the Emancipation Proclamation declared that all people that were held as slaves &ldquo;are, and henceforward shall be free.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><br/><p>Although mighty in theory, the Emancipation Proclamation was limited in that it applied only to those states that had seceded from the Union.&nbsp; Those parts of the Confederacy that were already under northern control as well as loyal border states were essentially exempt.&nbsp; Finally, it depended on Union military victory.</p><br/><p>On a positive note, it did change the character of the war given that as federal troops advanced, they did so in the name of freedom.&nbsp; As such, the Civil War become a moral one.&nbsp; It also allowed Black men into the Union Army and Navy for the first time.&nbsp; With almost 200,000 Black soldiers and sailors involved by the end of the war, the liberated were able to become the liberators.&nbsp; With the later approval of the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment in 1865, slavery finally became unconstitutional and illegal.</p><br/><p>To see the actual Emancipation Proclamation, click <a href="//1.usa.gov/ZdMMRJ">here</a>.</p>
