True to tradition, the following recipe is made in one pot, consistent with what likely occurred years ago on plantations where families received weekly rations based on what was available. <img style="float: right;" src="//bit.ly/TyPIXm" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> &nbsp; Put on a pot of rice and get ready to enjoy this fabulous shrimp Creole recipe. &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you need:</span> &nbsp; 2 tablespoons butter &nbsp; ¼ cup diced pimientos &nbsp; ½ cup diced onions &nbsp; ½ cup diced green pepper &nbsp; ¼ cup diced celery &nbsp; 2 cans crushed tomatoes &nbsp; 1 tablespoon minced garlic &nbsp; 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce &nbsp; ½ teaspoon ground red pepper &nbsp; 1 tablespoon sugar &nbsp; 2 bay leaves &nbsp; 1 ½ to 2 pounds boiled, deveined shrimp &nbsp; Tabasco sauce, and salt and pepper to taste &nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you do</span>: &nbsp; Melt butter in a large stock pot and sauté pimientos, pepper, onion, and celery until soft.
