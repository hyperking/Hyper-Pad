Sweet potatoes are a staple of Gullah cuisine that can be traced all the way back to West Africa, where it was a vital part of the region's agriculture thousands of years ago. Yes, yams and sweet potatoes are technically different (from a botanical perspective, they’re not even distantly related!), but it wasn’t too difficult of a leap for descendants of West African slaves in the American South to replace one root with the other. If you’re looking to delve into Gullah-style cooking, why not try some of these dishes? Here are two ways to prepare sweet potatoes as a perfect side or dessert to compliment a Gullah-Geechee meal. <h3>Sweet Potato Pone</h3> <strong>Ingredients</strong> <ul> <li>2 tablespoons margarine</li> <li>2 eggs</li> <li>1 cup dark cane sugar</li> <li>½ cup sugar</li> <li>2 large sweet potatoes</li> <li>½ teaspon salt</li> <li>1 teaspoon nutmeg</li> </ul> <strong>Instructions</strong> <ol> <li>Peel and grate sweet potatoes.</li> <li>Add other ingredients and mix thoroughly.</li> <li>Pour into greased baking dish and cook in slow oven at 300 degrees F until done, about 1 hour.</li> </ol> <h3>Sweet Potato Pie</h3> <strong>Ingredients</strong> <ul> <li>4 medium-sized sweet potatoes</li> <li>2 sticks butter</li> <li>3 cups sugar</li> <li>4 eggs</li> <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li> <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li> <li>Dash of cinnamon</li> <li>Dash of nutmeg</li> <li>½ can evaporated milk</li> </ul> <strong>Instructions</strong> <ol> <li>Cook potatoes until done in boiling water.</li> <li>Peel while hot and slice butter over them.</li> <li>Mash and beat with rotary beaters at high speed in a deep bowl.</li> <li>When smooth, rinse beaters and continue beating at high speed, adding sugar gradually.</li> <li>When dissolved, add eggs, vanilla, lemon juice, cinnamon and nutmeg.
