The Sea Islands are a chain of tidal and barrier islands on the Southeastern Atlantic Oceans coast of the United States. Numbering over 100, they are located between the mouths of the Santee and St. Johns Rivers along the coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The Sea Island culture is comprised of many different people but mainly one specific culture of people, Gullah. The Gullah, a rich and obscure culture, are descendants of enslaved Africans who worked on the rice plantations in South Carolina and Georgia. Today, the Sea Island culture still exists and has been maintained in many ways. Many Gullah people still live in small farming and fishing communities along the Atlantic coastal plain. Because of the strong community life and slight geographical location, the Gullah heritage has been preserves for many years. It is also celebrated in many ways and by this, the Sea Island culture has maintained its livelihood. For more ways to experience Gullah and Sea Island Culture, check out Gullahcelebration.com.
