Home cooking that shows some, and reminds others of, a traditional Gullah breakfast: featuring your choice of stewed oysters, shrimp in a savory lowcountry gravy, fried fresh catch fish paired with hot butter grits and fresh biscuits. Meals are prepared by people of the local Gullah community coordinated by Ooman Chef Louise Cohen.
