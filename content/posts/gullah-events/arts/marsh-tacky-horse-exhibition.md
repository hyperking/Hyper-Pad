Marsh Tacky horses were once the most common horse in the swampy and marshy Low Country. They were used for riding, pulling, and everything else that needed horsepower. It was feared that the breed had become extinct during the 1980’s and 1990’s, though this was found to be incorrect and there are an estimated 150 pure Marsh Tacky horses left. This is a hands-on experience that showcases the very horse that played an integral part in the survival of the Gullah people on Hilton Head Island. See you Sunday!
