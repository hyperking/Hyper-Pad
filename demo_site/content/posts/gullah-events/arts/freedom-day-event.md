National Freedom Day was established in 1948 by President Harry Truman in remembrance of February 1, 1865 - the day President Lincoln signed the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which outlawed slavery. We mark this historical occasion with artistsâ€™ interpretations and musical performances showcasing the contributions of African Americans in South Carolina History.
