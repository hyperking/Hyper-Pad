It is finally time for the Gullah Celebration <a href="//bit.ly/158fcfY">Oyster Roast/ Lowcountry Boil</a>! What could be a better way to wrap up this year’s festivities than with fresh, succulent oysters and peel-n-eat shrimp? In honor of our bivalve mollusk friends, here is a bit of information about oysters for your reading pleasure. <!--more--> &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="//on.natgeo.com/ZCjo4C">Oysters</a> are found in shallow waters throughout the world’s oceans in large colonies called “beds” or “reefs.” Although they are generally oval or pear-shaped, their appearance can vary depending on what they attach to. Usually, their rock-hard shells are whitish-gray in color and most oysters have a porcelain white body inside. They feed by extracting algae and other food particles through their gills. Oysters have the added intrigue of changing genders throughout their lifetime. &nbsp; It is surprisingly easy to roast oysters, although it is hard to imagine how the first people who ever ate them a) got them open and b) got past their appearance. If you are roasting oysters at home, the only required ingredients are a grill and oysters. You can use foil to keep the grill clean and melted butter for dipping as added components, but they are not required. Place all the oysters facing the same way on the foil or straight on the grill, ensuring that they are not stacked on top of each other. This helps them to cook evenly. &nbsp; Let your oysters cook until they start opening up. Once this occurs, you can use a fork or shucking knife to scoop out the insides, dip them in butter, and enjoy! Of course, if you’re out of charcoal, you can enjoy oysters raw as well. &nbsp; It goes without saying that it’s much more relaxing to enjoy them with us at Gullah Celebration! All you can eat oysters or shrimp for $17. Enjoy both for only $25. Come help us wrap up this year’s Hilton Head Island Gullah Celebration in style this Saturday, March 2nd, from noon to 4 pm at Shelter Cove.
