Thomas Curtis Barnwell, Jr. was born on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina on June 2, 1935.
His parents were Hannah White, a schoolteacher, and Thomas Barnwell, a farmer. Barnwell
grew up on Hilton Head Island when the only transportation on and off the island was by boat.
The native islanders were self sufficient by growing fresh vegetables, raising cows and hogs,
fishing, catching shrimp and crabs and hunting deer, rabbit and raccoon. Barnwell graduated
from St. Helena High School on St. Helena Island, South Carolina in 1954 and enrolled in Clafin
College in Orangeburg, South Carolina.


After one year at Clafin College, Barnwell joined the United States Air Force. In 1959, he
received an honorable discharge and enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama.

in Nashville, Tennessee in 1961; community development at the University of West Indies in
1963; group dynamics at the University of Ontario in Bethel, Maine in 1964 and community
development and community education at the University of Puerto Rico.


Barnwell began his work in community service at Penn Community Service, Inc. While at the
Penn Center, he worked in community organization, program planning, federal program
orientation and implementation. His community service work continued as he held positions as
Assistant Director for Beaufort­Jasper Hampton Economic Opportunity Commission, Executive
Director of Beaufort­Jasper­Hampton Comprehensive Health Services, Inc. and the Regional
Director of National Consumer Cooperative Bank, Charleston South Carolina branch. Barnwell
