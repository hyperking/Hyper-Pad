The 19th annual celebration features the artwork of emerging artist local artist <a href="//www.gullahcelebration.com/gullah-magazine/2014/October/artist-sonnal-thompson/" title="Artist Sonnal Thompson">Sonnal Thompson</a>. “Gullah culture is a way of life for native islanders on Hilton Head”, says Charles Young, Operations Manager of the Native Islander Business and Community Affairs Association, the parent organization of the Hilton Head Island Gullah Celebration. “Sonnal Thompson’s ‘Morning Catch’ is an relatable depiction of Gullah men, right here on Hilton Head, fishing for today’s dinner or stock the freezer for later. The real imagery is something that our annual event hopes to leave as a positive impression on of Gullah culture for our patrons and visiting friends.” Gullah culture is one of the oldest living and most distinct cultures in the United States, dating back over 300 years and rooted in the culture of West African slaves brought to the coastal islands of the South. The Hilton Head Island Gullah Celebration was established in 1996 to serve as a unique cultural showcase for the Gullah people, their language, food, cultural customs, and crafts.
