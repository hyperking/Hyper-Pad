By Associated Press <em>The festival celebrates the culture of the descendants of sea island slaves.</em> JOHNS ISLAND, S.C. (AP) - The commission working to preserve the culture of sea island slave descendants is hearing from Georgia residents on its plan to help preserve that culture. The Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission is scheduled to hold its quarterly meeting in Savannah on Friday. Chairwoman Althea Sumpter says the commission this year is listening to residents about the impact of the corridor management plan on their lives. Sumpter says the success of the preserving the culture depends on things done locally. The culture is known as Gullah in the Carolinas and Geechee in Georgia and Florida and the corridor runs from near Jacksonville, North Carolina to south of Jacksonville, Florida. The management plan was years in the making and approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2013.
