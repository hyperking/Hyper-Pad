<div>(From Gullah Cultural Legacies by Emory S. Campbell)</div> <div></div> Most traditional Gullah neighborhoods in the Sea Islands are uniquely autonomous, similar to their ancestral villages in West Africa. Historically they contained clustered extended families; a Praise House; essential skills bearers; (cast net makers, boat builders, etc.) spiritual leaders, food processing mills (sugarcane and corn) and access to the waterway. Together these qualities ensured sustainability. <div></div> <div>Yet their own particular produced good, service and natural environment brands each of these neighborhoods.</div> <div></div> <div>Like other Sea Islands, Hilton Head Island exemplifies this phenomenon in its ten villages that were established in the late 1860s:</div> <div></div> <div>•Stoney</div> <div>•Jonesville</div> <div>•Spanish Wells</div> <div>•Simmons Fishing Camp</div> <div>•Gardner-Marshland</div> <div>•Chaplin</div> <div>•Union Cemetary/Grassland</div> <div>•Mitchelville/Fish Haul (Baygall)</div> <div>•Squire Pope</div> <div>•Big Hill</div> <div></div> <div>Learn more about the Gullah neighborhoods on Hilton Head by taking a tour with Gullah Heritage Tours www.gullaheritage.com</div>
