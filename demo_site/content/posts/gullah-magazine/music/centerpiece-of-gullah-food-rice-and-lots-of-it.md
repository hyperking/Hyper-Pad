The Hoppin' John recipe is said to have come directly to America from West Africa.<br/><br/>This dish incorporates ham, rice, beans and onions, with the added kick of bacon and cayenne pepper.<br/><br/>Want to try it yourself? Here's a recipe from <a href="//bit.ly/PH4UA2">discoversouthcarolina.com</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br/><ul><br/> <li>1 cup chopped onion</li><br/> <li>1 tablespoon bacon drippings</li><br/> <li>2 cans (about 16 ounces each) black-eyed peas, slightly drained, or about 3 cups cooked black-eyed peas</li><br/> <li>1 cup chopped cooked ham</li><br/> <li>¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li><br/> <li>3 cups hot cooked rice</li><br/> <li>salt to taste</li><br/> <li>sliced sweet onion, optional</li><br/></ul><br/><strong>Preparation:</strong><br/><br/>In a large saucepan sauté chopped onion in bacon drippings until tender.

Serve Hoppin' John hot with sliced onion and cornbread.<br/><br/><strong>Jolly Jollies with Jollof Rice</strong><br/><img alt="" src="//bit.ly/XcQfiu" width="400" /><br/><br/><em>(Photo: Chef In You)</em><br/><br/>Much of the Gullah cuisine is rice-based and traditionally cooked in a single pot. Jollof rice is also referred to as 'Benachin', translating into "one pot" in the Wolof language. The recipe is very popular in West Africa.<br/><br/>Give this <a href="//bit.ly/11xZDMQ">Chef In You</a> recipe a try:<br/><strong>Ingredients</strong><br/><ul><br/> <li>1 cup rice (long grained or medium variety)</li><br/> <li>1 tsp cumin</li><br/> <li>1 tsp curry powder</li><br/> <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg powder</li><br/> <li>1 onion</li><br/> <li>2-3 cloves of garlic (as per taste)</li><br/> <li>1 inch piece of ginger, peeled and grated</li><br/> <li>1-2 green chillies ( or as per taste)</li><br/> <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li><br/> <li>2 large tomatoes,chopped finely</li><br/> <li>1 carrot,cubed</li><br/> <li>1 pkt Seitan, cut into small chunks ( about 2 cups - Skip it make this recipe gluten free</li><br/> <li>1/2 cup each of chopped beans and peas (I used frozen hence added last. If using fresh cook it along with the rice)</li><br/> <li>Salt to taste</li><br/> <li>Cilantro or parsley to garnish</li><br/></ul><br/><strong>Preparation</strong><br/><br/>Add 1/4 tsp groundnut oil, add the cumin seeds and when they splutter add onions along with ginger,garlic and chillies<br/><br/>Add the chopped carrots next and saute for a minute with little salt.<br/><br/>Add the tomato paste, tomatoes along with curry powder. Cook until tomatoes get slightly soft. Add the rice next. Saute for another 2 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Add 3 cups of vegetable stock/water, required salt,close the lid and cook until 90% cooked<br/><br/>Add the frozen peas and beans along with Seitan. Since I used to precooked variety, it just needed warming up and not cooking per se. Hence added them last along with frozen vegetables. If using fresh add it along with rice.<br/><br/>Stir it until well combined, add nutmeg and cook for another 5-6 minutes or so for the flavors to get together. Add lots of garnish and serve hot.
