After a successful <a href="//bit.ly/SxVmGx">Kickstarter campaign</a>, one photographer will be able to accomplish his goal of telling the history of Gullah culture in photographs. <!--more--> Pete Marovich, who lives in Washington D.C., used to live in Beaufort as a child, and now seeks to document the history and lives of the Gullah/Geechee people. His project, <em>Shadows of the Gullah</em>, raised over $7,000 in Kickstarter funds. He plans to use the money to photograph the effects of real estate development and the pressures they are adding to the native Gullah communities in South Carolina and Georgia. According to <a href="//bit.ly/SxVAgY">the Charleston City Paper</a>: <blockquote>"The Gullah/Geechee of Sapelo Island, Ga., are the latest to fall victim to encroaching development. For generations, they've been the primary private landowners on Sapelo, but investors have slowly and quietly been buying up the island, increasing county taxes sharply and leaving many Gullah/Geechee distraught as they struggle to keep their homes."</blockquote> According to the City Paper, Marovich says his project supporters will receive updates from Marovich, photo prints, and signed books at the conclusion of <em>Shadows</em>.
